## Overview

Build a dashboard for observing customer orders. The dashboard should have the following features:

- A card that shows the total number of pending and completed orders (separately)
- A card that shows the average order value
- A card that shows the total amount spent per month on the platform
- A card that shows the highest value order, who made it and what they bought
